============

Level / map editor for old school dungeon crawling games.

Create 2D maps for old school dungeon crawling / rogue like games or tile based games.

Controls:
- Left mouse button marks a tile.
- Right mouse button deletes a tile
- Middle mouse button choose between tile types
- Ctrl + left mouse button enters a comment to a tile
- Ctrl + s saves map

Uses OpenGL + glut for rendering the map and the text so i supposed it can be considered as cross platform.
For now the map size is fixed at 80 x 50 tiles.

The editor is mainly designed to generate 3D geometry of the map so it can be used for a 3D fps
rogue like / dungeon crawling game. Various optimizations are applied in order to discard redundant geometry.

The editor by default loads the map.txt found in the same folder. When a map is saved (ctrl + s) a name will be requested.
The map is saved in ASCII text. A binary file with the same name and a .bsp suffix is also saved. It contains the geometry generated by the editor.
This file, along with the ASCII file is loaded by the from_scratch engine.
